    <h2>Sweet and delicious, learn how to make a vanilla pudding</h2>
    <p>Vanilla pudding is a creamy, sweet milk-based dessert that is typically thickened with a combination of cornstarch or flour and eggs, and then flavored with vanilla. It can be made from scratch using milk, sugar, and vanilla extract, or from a boxed mix. Vanilla pudding is often enjoyed on its own, as a base for other desserts like banana pudding or trifle, or topped with fresh fruit or whipped cream.</p>
